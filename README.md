## Getting Started

### What is Plogging?
Plogging is a combination of Jogging with picking up litter merging the Swedish verbs ***plocka*** upp (pick up) and ***jogga***(jog) gives the new Swedish verb ***plogga***, from which the workd plogging derives).

### The reason why we named "Isak"

During the flogging process, you naturally bend your back. So we thought this posture was very similar to the prople from one of the famous paintings, "The Gleaners".
In Korean, "the Gleaners" sounds like "Isak". Therefore, our team decided the logo and application name in this way.

### Our goal

We selected several of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals to create an flutter application. 

#### Good Health and Well-Being

Plogging is an activity to pick up trash while running. App users can improve their health while using this application. Also they can do "well-being" by sharing their progress with people around the world and friends.
