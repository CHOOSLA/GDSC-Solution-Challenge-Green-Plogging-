## Getting_Started

### What is Plogging?
Plogging is a combination of Jogging with picking up litter merging the Swedish verbs ***plocka*** upp (pick up) and ***jogga***(jog) gives the new Swedish verb ***plogga***, from which the workd plogging derives).


## What is Sustainable Development Goals?

The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
As can be seen in the figure above, there are 17 goals.


### Our goal

We selected several of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals to create an flutter application. And we found activities that can take care of my health and help the environment. After that, we found the actrivity "plogging", and we thought it would be nice if we could add additional features to draw interest from users.


#### Good Health and Well-Being

Plogging is an activity to pick up trash while running. App users can improve their health while using this application. Also they can do "well-being" by sharing their progress with people around the world and friends.


#### Responsible consumption and production

As mentioned above, the positive aspects of the environment and sustainable consumption can ve derived through the action of picking up recycled waste.



### The reason why we named "Isak"

During the flogging process, you naturally bend your back. So we thought this posture was very similar to the prople from one of the famous paintings, "The Gleaners".
In Korean, "the Gleaners" sounds like "Isak". Therefore, our team decided the logo and application name in this way.
